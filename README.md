### Code
The markdown structure of this readme was based on the structure of the following readme.md files from other Code Institute student projects:
- https://github.com/4n4ru/CI_MS1_BodelschwingherHof
- https://github.com/jamie2210/CI_MS1_TBC
- https://github.com/jeremyhsimons/CI_PP3_DungeonEscape

The deployment steps for the project were adapted from the following readme.md file by Jeremy Simons:
- https://github.com/jeremyhsimons/CI_PP3_DungeonEscape

- Google sheets code: The method and code (Google drive and sheets scope and creds code, print_high_scores(), and store_high_scores() functions) to update, retrieve, and print leaderboard scores via a Google Sheet were adpated from the [LoveSandwiches Project](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/love-sandwiches-p5-sourcecode/tree/master/05-deployment/01-deployment-part-1) by the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/)

- Round numbers to ASCII words code: The use of the Num2Words library was based on a suggestion from [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) by [openai.com](https://openai.com/). The code was adapted from examples provided by [num2words](https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/num2words) by [savoirfairelinux](https://github.com/savoirfairelinux)

- Print text center code: The method for printing text in the center of the terminal was adapted from the [Python String center() Method](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_center.asp) article by [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)

- Rainbow text code: The approach to print text in a rainbow color (print_rainbow()) using Colorama was adapted from an answer by [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) by [openai.com](https://openai.com/)

- Wait for keypress code: The code to block code execution while waiting for the user to press a key (wait_for_keypress()) was largely provided by an answer from [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) by [openai.com](https://openai.com/)

- Randomly shuffle letters code: The method for shuffling a list of letters was adapted from the [Python Random shuffle() Method](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_random_shuffle.asp) article by [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)

- Dictionary meaning check code: The code used to check words against a dictionary and return their meanings (check_dictionary() and print_word_meaning()) uses the library and code examples provided in [PyDictionary](https://github.com/geekpradd/PyDictionary) written by [geekpradd](https://github.com/geekpradd)

- Profanity check code: The code used to check words against a profanity list (check_profanity()) uses the library and code examples provided in [Alt-profanity-check](https://github.com/dimitrismistriotis/alt-profanity-check) written by [dimitrismistriotis](https://github.com/dimitrismistriotis) which is based on [profanity-check](https://github.com/vzhou842/profanity-check) by [Victor Zhou](https://github.com/vzhou842)

- Check letters used validation: The approach to use a Counter to check the player's input only uses the chosen / conundrum letters (check_letters_used()) was adapted from an answer by [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) by [openai.com](https://openai.com/)

- Check numbers used validation: The approach to use a Counter to check the player's input only uses the chosen numbers (check_numbers_used()) was adapted from an answer by [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) by [openai.com](https://openai.com/)

- Anagram solver code: The code used to solve an anagram (longest_word()) uses the library and code examples (with an adapted approach - see [Anagram Solver Feature](#anagram-solver)) provided in [anagram-solver](https://github.com/patrickleweryharris/anagram-solver) written by [patrickleweryharris](https://github.com/patrickleweryharris)

- Numbers round string evaludation code: Knowing eval() isn't a secure approach to evaluating a string, a Google search turned up this [Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/43836903) by [MSeifert](https://stackoverflow.com/users/5393381/mseifert), which recommended the numexp library. The numbers round user solution input validation (validate_user_solution()) uses the library and code examples provided in [numexpr](https://github.com/pydata/numexpr) written by [pydata](https://github.com/pydata)

- Numbers round solver code: The code used to provide solutions to the numbers round (solve_numbers_round()) uses the library and code examples provided in [countdown-numbers-solver](https://github.com/exitexit) written by [exitexit](https://github.com/exitexit)

- Leaderboard table format: The use of PrettyTable to print the high score leaderboard in an ASCII table format was based on a suggestion by [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) by [openai.com](https://openai.com/)
