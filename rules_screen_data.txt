This isn't countdown, this is just a tribute!
This game is variation on the Countdown game you have seen on TV.

* This is a one-player game consisting of three letters rounds, one
numbers round, and one conundrum round.

* In each letters round, you are given nine random letters and must form
valid words using those letters within 30 seconds. To be valid, words 
need to be found in PyDictionary and more than 2 letters long. You earn
1 point for each letter in your word multiplied by the time remaining.

* In the numbers round, you are asked to choose six numbers which will be 
randomly selected from two groups of numbers: 
'large numbers' (25, 50, 75, 100) and 'small numbers' (1 to 10).

You can choose from 0 to 4 'large numbers', and the remaining numbers will
be selected from the 'small numbers group'. You are then provided with a 
random 3 digit target number.

Your goal is to use your 6 numbers and basic mathematical operations
(+ - * /) to reach the target number. Here's an example input to reach a 
target number of 304:

100 * 3 + 12 / 3

Remember order of operations when constructing your expression: 
Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, and Division (from left to right),
Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). 

You earn points based on the time remaining multiplied by 10 for
each valid solution you find.

* The conundrum round features a nine-letter anagram that you need to 
unscramble within the given time limit. You earn 10 points for a correct
guess based multiplied by your time remaining If you guess a word
that is valid but not our target word, we'll let you know, and you still
score 10 points!

* Your total score is calculated by summing the points earned in each 
round.
